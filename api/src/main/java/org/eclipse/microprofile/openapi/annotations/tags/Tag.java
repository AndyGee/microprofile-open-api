/**
 * This object represents a tag. A tag is meta-information you can use to help
 * organize your API endpoints and it can appear in two contexts.
 * <p>
 * Define tag objects on a method that implements an operation or on a type that
 * contains operations. They will be gathered and stored in the root object of
 * the OpenAPI document.
 * <p>
 * If the tag annotation is associated with a method that corresponds to an
 * operation then the tag name will be added to the OpenAPI document and also be
 * added to the operation tags (see @Operation).
 * <p>
 * If more than one tag is defined with the same name then only one tag with that name
 * will appear in the OpenAPI document. 
 * <p>
 * If more than one tag is defined with the same name and only one tag contains a 
 * description that is a non-empty string then that description will be preserved in 
 * the OpenAPI document. If more than one non-empty description is specified the results 
 * are implementation dependent. 
 * <p>
 * If more than one tag is defined with the same name and only one tag contains an
 * external documentation that is defined with at least one non-empty string then that 
 * external documentation will be preserved in the OpenAPI document. If more than one 
 * non-empty external documentation is specified the results are implementation dependent. 
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Tag(name = "luggage", description = "Operations related to luggage handling.")
 * &#64;GET
 * public Location getLuggage(LuggageID id) {
 *     return getLuggageLocation(id);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * If the tag annotation is applied to a type then the tag is defined in OpenAPI and a
 * reference is added to each operation in the type.
 * <p>
 * Operations in your application can contain references to tag definitions to
 * help organize the software. The @Operation annotation may contain a list of
 * tag names.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Operation(summary = "Track luggage in the international division", 
 *      tags = { "luggage", "international" }, ...
 * </pre>
